# SMART RECEPTIONIST



In the Entrance of every company, Reception is there to check the Visitors details and Employee details and all other details of the company. That all are managed by one person he is called Receptionist. In this Project, we are developing one system that Performs the work of Receptionist in an automatic manner. Here we use Face recognition to find out the Person visited the company. If the new person visited  the company means his face is Stored in Database. If the other old persons visited the company means This system book the Appointment for that person. Once the face is Recorded means it can identify whenever the Person visited the company. The System reduces the human work and manpower

Computer-based face detection and recognition systems are rapidly spreading are various sectors such as malls, universities, and ministries. The goal of this research is to build a system that can detect and recognize faces of people using image-processing techniques. Practically, this idea can be implemented in large places to provide security. The benefits of this system are:

* Use available computers (servers) in corporation with microcomputers.
* Expand the desired microcomputer capabilities.
* Implement the face detection and recognition algorithms to run over the microcomputer to notice the effect of combining multiple computers with a microcontroller.
Using multiple servers â€“ three in this scenario- will allow a faster recognition for a stream of faces, instead of working among the same microcomputer to detect and recognize the stream of faces, which implies to divide the process in between the different electronics available to reduce the processing time for both detection and recognition.
